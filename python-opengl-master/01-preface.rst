This book is open-access (i.e. it's free to read at `this address
<http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/python-opengl>`_) because I believe
knowledge should be free. However, if you think the book is worth a few
dollars, you can give me a few euros (`5€
<https://www.paypal.me/NicolasPRougier/5>`_ or `10€
<https://www.paypal.me/NicolasPRougier/10>`_). This money will help me to
travel to Python conferences and to write other books as well.  If you don't
have money, it's fine. Just enjoy the book and spread the word about it. The
teaser image above comes from the `artwork section
<http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/artwork/index.html>`_ of my website. It has
been made some years ago using the `Povray <http://www.povray.org>`_
(Persistence of Vision) raytracer. I like it very much because it is a kind of
résumé of my `research
<http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/research/index.html>`_.
           

About the author
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a full-time research scientist at Inria_ which is the French national
institute for research in computer science and control. This is a public
scientific and technological establishment (EPST) under the double supervision
of the Research & Education Ministry, and the Ministry of Economy Finance and
Industry. I'm working within the Mnemosyne_ project which lies at the frontier
between integrative and computational neuroscience in association with the
`Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases`_, the Bordeaux laboratory for
research in computer science (LaBRI_), the `University of Bordeaux`_ and the
national center for scientific research (CNRS_).

I've been using Python for more than 15 years and numpy for more than 10 years
for modeling in neuroscience, machine learning and for advanced visualization
(OpenGL). I'm the author of several online resources and tutorials (Matplotlib,
numpy, OpenGL) and I've been teaching Python, numpy and scientific
visualization at the University of Bordeaux and in various conferences and
schools worldwide (SciPy, EuroScipy, etc). I'm also the author of the popular
article `Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures`_ , a popular `matplotlib
tutorial`_ and an open access book `From Python To Numpy`_.



About this book
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This book has been written in |ReST|_ format and generated using a `customized
version <rst2html.py>`_ of the docutils rst2html.py command line (available from
the docutils_ python package) and a custom `template <book-template.txt>`_.

If you want to rebuild the html output, from the top directory, type:

.. code-block::

   $ ./rst2html.py --link-stylesheet            \
                   --cloak-email-addresses      \
                   --toc-top-backlinks          \
                   --stylesheet book.css        \
                   --stylesheet-dirs .          \
                   book.rst book.html

Or you use the provided `make.sh <make.sh>`_ shell script.
                   
The sources are available from https://github.com/rougier/python-opengl.

Last point, I wrote the book in a kind of modern `Kerouac
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kerouac>`_'s style such that you can
download it once and continue reading it offline. Initial loading may be
slow though.

Prerequisites
+++++++++++++

This is not a Python nor a NumpPy beginner guide and you should have an
intermediate level in both Python and NumPy. No prior knowledge of OpenGL is
necessary because I'll explain everything.

Conventions
+++++++++++

I will use usual naming conventions. If not stated explicitly, each script
should import numpy, scipy and glumpy as:

.. code-block:: python
   
   import numpy as np


We'll use up-to-date versions (at the date of writing, i.e. August, 2017) of the
different packages:

=========== =========
Packages    Version
=========== =========
Python      3.6.0
----------- ---------
Numpy       1.12.0
----------- ---------
Scipy       0.18.1
----------- ---------
Cython      0.25.2
----------- ---------
Triangle    20170106
----------- ---------
Glumpy      1.0.6
=========== =========

Publishing
++++++++++

If you're an editor interested in publishing this book, you can `contact me
<mailto:Nicolas.Rougier@inria.fr>`_ if you agree to have this version and all
subsequent versions open access (i.e. online at `this address
<http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/python-opengl>`_), you know how to deal
with `restructured text <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (Word is
not an option), you provide a real added-value as well as supporting services,
and more importantly, you have a truly amazing latex book template (and be
warned that I'm a bit picky about typography & design: `Edward Tufte
<https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/>`_ is my hero). Still here?
